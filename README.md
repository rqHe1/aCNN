# aCNN
This is the main code and data for aCNN, as discussed in the article by Jia-Qi Wang, Han-Qing Wu, Rong-Qiang He, and Zhong-Yi Lu on Variational optimization of the amplitude of neural-network quantum many-body ground states [arXiv.2308.09664 (2023) https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2308.09664].

All parameters can be set in the 'config_file.py' file. The results presented in the article can be replicated using pre-trained models, which are listed in the 'read_mdlparams' file.
